# MLOps – Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline for heart disease prediction.  
It covers data acquisition, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, CI/CD, experiment tracking, containerization, API deployment, monitoring, and documentation.

##  1. Setup & Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sreedhar30/MLOps-Heart-Disease
cd MLOps-Heart-Disease
Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / Mac
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset: Heart disease CSV
Dataset sourced from UCI Heart Disease dataset.
Data preprocessing performed in notebooks/EDA.ipynb.

Handled missing values with median/mode imputation

Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler

Encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoder

Visualizations included:
✔ Histograms
✔ Correlation heatmap
✔ Target distribution
✔ Missing values chart

(Screenshots in screenshots/EDA/)

3. Feature Engineering & Model Development
Models trained:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Best metrics logged via MLflow:
✔ Accuracy
✔ Precision
✔ Recall
✔ ROC-AUC

Random Forest selected as final model.

4. Experiment Tracking (MLflow)
Tracked:

Parameters

Metrics

Model artifacts

MLflow UI shows both model runs.
(Screenshots in screenshots/step3_Git.png)

5. CI/CD Pipeline
Automated testing using PyTest.
Linting using Flake8.
GitHub Actions workflow includes:
✔ Linting
✔ Unit testing
✔ Training execution

Tests located in tests/.
(Screenshots in screenshots/Step5/pytest sucess.png)

6. Model Packaging & API
Used FastAPI to serve model predictions.
Endpoints:

bash
Copy code
GET  /
POST /predict
GET  /metrics
Returns:
✔ Prediction
✔ Confidence
✔ API metrics

Containerized using Docker.
(Screenshots in screenshots/Step6)

7. Production Deployment
Deployed on local Kubernetes (Docker Desktop):

✔ Deployment manifest
✔ Service NodePort (http://localhost:30007/docs)

(Screenshots in screenshots/Step7/)

8. Monitoring & Logging
Implemented API request logging:
✔ Request path
✔ Status code
✔ Response time
✔ Total requests

Added metrics endpoint:

bash
Copy code
GET /metrics
(Screenshots in screenshots/Step8/)
